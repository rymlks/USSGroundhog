Thanks for checking out Easy State v3! 

In older versions of Unity Newtonsoft was not included by default. If you are getting errors about Newtonsoft not be found go to:

"Assets/EasyState/Newtonsoft/Runtime/Newtonsoft.Json.dll"

Check "Include/Editor" option and apply changes.

then go to: 

"Assets/EasyState/Newtonsoft/Runtime/AOT/Newtonsoft.Json.dll"

Check whatever build platform your game is using.
