Re-traversing the rotating debris maze is pretty frustrating - easy mode give shortcut earlier
Make shortcuts a little less linear
Not taking first shortcut really blows ass
exploders that give no corpse should tell you
weird activatable in quickdoor room
funiman key should do anything when it hits the gold panel
combinations of planet activations in sun room confusing (no real reason to use red planet)
