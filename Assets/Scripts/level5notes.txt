Re-traversing the rotating debris maze is pretty frustrating - easy mode give shortcut earlier
Make shortcuts a little less linear
Not taking first shortcut really blows ass
exploders that give no corpse should tell you
weird activatable in quickdoor room
funiman key should do anything when it hits the gold panel
combinations of planet activations in sun room confusing (no real reason to use red planet)


Antonio playthrough:
- figured out room1
- figured out circle room
- took a while to figure out 2planets room
    - Still didnt try using green planet
- we told him about shortcuts
    - died to the ring room same way connor did
- unlocked the elevator - thought it was called one place or another
- add a respawn point to the final room - 



Roland playthrough:
- tried to squeeze under first door (died)
- Had some trouble rolling the ball into the panel
- Stood up in the freeze chamber (you really shouldnt be able to do that)
- clearly had prior knowledge of cirlce room puzzle
- didnt notice the fires were put out
- Literally everyone tries to use ball corpse on sun room panel
- We told him how to beat sun room
- accidentally beat the space vacuum puzzle while dead
- didnt do the shortcut RIP
- Knew that he had the key to the second shortcut door
- cant figure out floor aura fast door puzzle
- had to quit due to carpal tunnel :(
- Everybody dies to the saturn rings
