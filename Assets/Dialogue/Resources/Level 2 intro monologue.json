    "Oh good, you found the drone bay.  Sorry about the bad tip with the rescue ship.",
    "OK, look - how was I supposed to know it was rigged?  It looked like a regular rescue ship to me too!",
    "Anyway.  We need to launch a drone and take a look around.  There has to be someone who can help us.",
    "However, the Groundhog's sensors are *way* offline - you saw the bridge - so we need some eyes out there.",
    "This bay manufactures and replenishes drones as needed, so don't worry about screwing up.",
    "However, it nominally has (had?) a crew of 4, so you might have to get creative to cause a launch."
