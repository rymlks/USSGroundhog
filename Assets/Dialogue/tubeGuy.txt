hey man.  station AI's going crazy, it has a protection directive but somehow decided the best way to protect us was to start killing people!

some of the terminals and controls now only work for *our corpses*, not us, and they've turned red instead of blue

no thanks, i'm not coming out.  Nice and safe in here.

It's a mess out there and I bought the cheapest tier death insurance so I'm almost out of insured clonings.  I can't afford to die any more!

You're on the Platinum plan, though.  Maybe you could escape.  I would appreciate it if you sent some help for me if you do.  Good luck.

Oh!  Remember to stay regular.  Every time you can poop, poop.
