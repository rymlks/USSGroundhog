Import this package into your project. 

--------WARNING -----------
Best done before you have created any data using Easy State as this could overwrite some of your progress! 
---------------------------

To remove the samples from your project, delete the samples folder and then delete the EasyState data folder. If you've made any designs deleting the EasyStateData folder will delete your designs as well! So as previously stated, best to only import samples with an empty project.  
 
The samples are :
- First State Machine
A demo of the simplest state machine possible, to introduce the user to Easy State.
- Assorted Examples
A couple state machines are placed in a single scene. Each state machine comes with a description and notes to help explain and showcase various Easy State features.
- Robot
A little robot runs around a scene picking up trash and throwing it in a trash burner. This demo demonstrates a slightly more complex scenarios showing how Easy State and Unity work together. There are two control schemes for the robot. Using one state machine an AI dictates the movement of the robot. In the other, the player can click with their mouse to tell the robot where to go. 

-Refresh Rates
